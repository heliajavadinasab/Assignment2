         <p class="my-text">
          Black Mirror is a British anthology television series
           created by Charlie Brooker. Individual episodes explore 
           a diversity of genres, but most are set in near-future dystopias
           with science fiction technologyâ€”a type of speculative fiction.
            The series is based on The Twilight Zone and uses technology to 
            comment on contemporary social issues. Most episodes are written by Brooker,
             with heavy involvement by the executive producer Annabel Jones.
